### Generation of SSH keys

### Transferring datasets

In general there are two options to transfer your dataset from a remote location to the cluster. One option is to rely on [NFS](#NFS) directly, while the other transfers your dataset over an [SSH](#SSH) connection. There is no preferred option. Both are equally suitable. However, if you are dealing with sensitive data we recommend to rely on SSH as NFS transfers are not encrypted.

```console
you@alan-master:~$ mkdir Datasets
```
